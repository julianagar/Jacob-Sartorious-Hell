**disclaimer**
this may crash certain computers so please use with caution. 

also please dont be a jackass and put this on someone else's computer or a school/work computer. like i said before im not responsble for any damage you may cause or any trouble you get into when using this program. **USE WITH CAUTION**

**for delays:**
the delays are set so the youtube video can load before moving onto opening another video, since the video wont play unless the tab is open. so, this basically means the delay needs to be set based on your network speed and the peformance of your computer. for my computer, which has about 8gb of ram and is hooked up to a network with about 140 mbps, a delay between 2 and 3.5 seconds had worked for me. i suggest just using trial and error when trying to find what your delay should be.
